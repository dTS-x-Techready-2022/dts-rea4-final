# About this project

There are a variety of games to choose from, and we provide you with all the information you need to know before choosing one that's right for you!

we create this website using react.js on the front end and firebase as the backend to store our data.

As this is our final project, we primarily worked on learning the fundamentals of front-end development and back-end development.

In the future, we will be working on enhancing the application's UX by creating new user interfaces and adding additional features.
