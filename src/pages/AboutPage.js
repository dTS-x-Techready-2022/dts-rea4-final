            There are a variety of games to choose from, and we provide you with
            all the information you need to know before choosing one that's

            end and firebase as the backend to store our data. As this is our
            final project, we primarily worked on learning the fundamentals of
            front-end development and back-end development. In the future, we
            will be working on enhancing the application's UX by creating new
            user interfaces and adding additional features.
